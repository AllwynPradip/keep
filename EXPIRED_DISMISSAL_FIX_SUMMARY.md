# Enhanced Fix for Expired Dismissal CEL Filtering Issue

**GitHub Issue**: [#5047 - CEL filters not returning alerts with dismissed: false after dismissedUntil expires](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/5047)

## Problem Summary

When an alert is dismissed using a workflow with `dismissed: true` and `dismissedUntil: [future timestamp]`, and that dismissal expires (the `dismissedUntil` time passes), the alert no longer appears when filtering by `dismissed == false` in CEL expressions, even though its payload shows `dismissed: false`.

This affects both:
- Sidebar filters in the alert feed ("Not dismissed")  
- CEL-based filters using `dismissed == false`

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurs because there are **two different paths for CEL filtering** in the Keep codebase:

### 1. **SQL-based CEL filtering** (used by search engine and query APIs)
- **Location**: `keep/api/core/alerts.py` in `query_last_alerts()`
- **How it works**: Converts CEL expressions to SQL and queries the database directly
- **Problem**: Looks at raw `dismissed` field in `alertenrichment.enrichments` JSON column
- **Issue**: Has no knowledge of `dismissedUntil` expiration logic

### 2. **Python-based CEL filtering** (used by rules engine)  
- **Location**: `keep/rulesengine/rulesengine.py` in `filter_alerts()`
- **How it works**: Works on `AlertDto` objects after they've been validated
- **Problem**: Works correctly because `AlertDto` validation handles expiration

### The Disconnect

The `AlertDto` model has a `validate_dismissed` validator that correctly handles `dismissedUntil` expiration:

```python
@validator("dismissed", pre=True, always=True)
def validate_dismissed(cls, dismissed, values):
    # ... validation logic that sets dismissed=False when dismissedUntil expires
```

However, this validation only runs when `AlertDto` objects are created from database data. The **SQL-based CEL filtering never sees this validation** because it queries the database directly.

## Enhanced Solution Implementation

### 1. **Added Database Cleanup Function with Comprehensive Logging**

**File**: `keep/api/core/db.py`

Added `cleanup_expired_dismissals()` function that:
- Finds enrichments where `dismissed=true` and `dismissedUntil` is in the past
- Updates those enrichments to set `dismissed=false` in the database
- Ensures SQL queries see the correct expired dismissal state
- **NEW**: Comprehensive logging at all stages of the cleanup process

```python
def cleanup_expired_dismissals(tenant_id: str, session: Session = None):
    """
    Clean up expired alert dismissals by setting dismissed=false for alerts
    where dismissedUntil time has passed.
    
    This ensures that SQL-based CEL filtering works correctly for expired dismissals.
    """
    logger.info("Starting cleanup of expired dismissals", extra={"tenant_id": tenant_id})
    
    # Detailed logging throughout the process:
    # - Current time and tenant context
    # - Number of potentially expired dismissals found
    # - Individual dismissal checks with timing details
    # - Success/failure of each update operation
    # - Final summary with counts and performance metrics
```

**Enhanced Logging Features:**
- 📊 **Performance metrics**: Query duration and update counts
- 🔍 **Detailed inspection**: Individual alert fingerprints and expiration times
- ⏰ **Time tracking**: Exact expiration timing calculations
- 🚨 **Error handling**: Graceful handling of invalid date formats
- 📈 **Summary reporting**: Total dismissals checked vs. updated

### 2. **Integrated Cleanup Into Query Process**

**File**: `keep/api/core/alerts.py`

Modified `query_last_alerts()` to call cleanup before executing CEL queries:

```python
def query_last_alerts(tenant_id, query: QueryDto) -> Tuple[list[Alert], int]:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    with Session(engine) as session:
        # Clean up expired dismissals if CEL query involves dismissed field
        if query_with_defaults.cel and "dismissed" in query_with_defaults.cel:
            try:
                cleanup_expired_dismissals(tenant_id, session)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"Failed to cleanup expired dismissals: {e}")
        
        # ... rest of query logic ...
```

**File**: `keep/searchengine/searchengine.py`

Also added cleanup to the search engine's CEL search method with the same pattern.

### 3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage with Time Travel**

**File**: `tests/test_expired_dismissal_cel_fix_enhanced.py`

Created extensive test suite using `freezegun` for realistic time-based testing:

#### **Time Travel Test Scenarios:**

1. **⏰ Realistic Time Progression**:
   ```python
   with freeze_time(start_time) as frozen_time:
       # Dismiss alert until 10:30 AM
       # Test at 10:00 AM (should be dismissed)
       # Travel to 10:15 AM (still dismissed)  
       # Travel to 10:45 AM (should be expired)
   ```

2. **🔄 Mixed Expiration Scenarios**:
   - Multiple alerts with different expiration times
   - Some expire at 10 minutes, others at 30 minutes
   - Forever dismissals that never expire
   - Already expired dismissals

3. **🧪 Edge Case Testing**:
   - Exact boundary conditions (expires at exactly current time)
   - Invalid date formats (graceful error handling)
   - Microsecond precision testing
   - Performance with 20+ alerts

4. **🚀 API Integration Testing**:
   - Full end-to-end testing through API endpoints
   - Real dismissal workflow via `/alerts/batch_enrich`
   - Query testing via `/alerts/query` with CEL
   - Time travel through complete user scenarios

#### **Key Test Features:**
- **Real time passing**: Using `freezegun` to actually advance time
- **Comprehensive logging validation**: Ensures all expected log messages appear
- **Performance monitoring**: Tracks query duration and efficiency
- **Boundary testing**: Tests exact expiration timing
- **Error resilience**: Validates graceful handling of edge cases

### 4. **Enhanced Demonstration Script**

**File**: `test_fix_demo.py`

Updated standalone demonstration with freezegun integration:

```python
def test_time_travel_scenario():
    """Test a realistic time travel scenario using freezegun."""
    with freeze_time(start_time) as frozen_time:
        # Create alert dismissed until 2:30 PM
        # Test at 2:00 PM (active dismissal)
        # Travel to 2:15 PM (still active)
        # Travel to 2:45 PM (expired - should cleanup)
```

## Fix Verification

### Demonstration Results
